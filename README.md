# coronavirus-stats-analysis
This is my first ever data analysis project using python. 
It has provided me with an opportunity to apply the pandas syntax that I have learned in a more abstract setting. 
You have to start somewhere, and I am looking forward to improving in the future, to increase the complexity of my analysis, write more pythonic code, and fine-tune my use of presentation tools.
